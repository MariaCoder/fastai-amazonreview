Baseline Steps

1. Drop anything with less than 50 total votes 
2. Binning: 75% and up is helpful, below is not helpful 
3. Assure equal numbers of helpful and non-helpful votes by random sampling


Experimentation Ideas

Dewsy suggested concatenating summary and text (summary comes first)
Clean-up: eliminate duplicates in data 
Clean-up/labeling: mark scammer/duplicates as non-helpful, if they aren't already

Data Format

CSV (tip: when loading, cast to smaller datatypes)
